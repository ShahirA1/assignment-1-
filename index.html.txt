<h1>Interest in IT </h1>
<p>With technology dictating most parts of life these days its easy to get interested in knowing some basic knowledge in 
the field of information technology. This is the reason why I am interested in learning some knowledge in IT since technology is very important now days. Hence having some understanding in this field of area can put me in an advantage over others in regard to finding jobs or taking advantage of the situation (make a business). Currently I have no experience in IT and it has left me feeling like I am lacking in an important area, this feeling has led me to try and gain some understanding of this field.</p>
<p>I have chosen RMIT university as I am already a student here and know the system and curriculum of the university. Studying with other universities would have left me in a disadvantage since I would have to get used to the system which I don’t have time for.</p>
<p>I would like to take away from this course some basic knowledge of IT such as basic coding and how the IT world behaves. This is a new area for me so being able to learn more on this area would be crucial to me. As it would give me an insight on how the field is and if it can be an ideal career pathway in the future if my current career pathway doesn’t work out. </p>

<h1>Ideal Job</h1>
<p>Browsing through seek I came across this particular job and it has caught my attention. First reason because it is part time, and this allows me to pursue other interests at the same time. Its also a low-level IT job and this would mean you can start from the bottom and gain experience and knowledge as you move up into higher positions with more responsibility, which this to me seems can prepare me for that kind of positions. Some of the skills and qualifications for this job include knowing how to backup, designing networks and implementation,
 knowledge on WAN, VPN, VLANs, NAS and Microsoft certifications. </p>
<p>This is a job that I would like to work in if I was to pursue an IT degree. Currently I have no experience, skills or qualifications in IT and this subject is the first time I have enrolled in an IT course or subject. Saying that I would like to learn some basic IT knowledge that can allow me to work as help desk support etc.</p>

<h1>Profile</h1>
<p>The result for my Meyrs-Briggs test was an ISTP, this means that I tend to be curious, pragmatic and confident. Also, the results mention that I can be unpredictable and spontaneous but often quite and prefer to think and process information internally.</p>
<p>The result for my learning style test was Aural learner. Aural learners are those who best learn when information is presented to them by voice. Such as when information is presented in the form of a lecture or while having a conversation.</p>
<p>The result for my creativity test was 48 out of 80. This result means that my creativity is a work in progress, that I should share and ask for feedback from others regarding my ideas. Also adopting collaborative approaches to problem finding. 
These results may mean that I would be better in a group, as I am not too introverted and not uncreative.</p>

<h1>Project Ideas </h1>
<p>My project idea is to make an app. This app will be used to connect customers to their preferred barber shop. The customer would be able to check what barber shops in the closest locations are available and what the prices are. Once the customer chooses the barber shop, they chose time and date and their position is reserved. They customer must pay before hand as to stop any time wasters. The app will also allow the customers to choose what hairstyle they like as well as other services if provided by the barber shop such as beard shave etc.</p>
<p>I believe this is an interesting and useful project because for men at least going to the barbers is a common event, so there will definitely be a market for such an app. Currently going to the barber shops means a lot of time spent waiting for your turn. But with this app that would no longer be an issue. The app will also allow the customer to show the barber a visual image of the style they would and remove the need to verbally tell how you would like your hair to be cut, which can be differently interpreted by different barbers. .</p>
<p>The app will be similar to apps that are already out there for other reason, such as Uber and Uber eat. This app will have options for the customer to check out all the barber shops in the region (all the barber shops that have signed up to the app). From here they can read reviews left by other users and compare the prices. Currently finding barber shops and knowing more about them is near impossible. But with this app that will be no more a problem. The customer after choosing the barber shop they would like to get their haircut will 
then be able to choose the type of hair style they would like to get. Here they are able to design or chose from already made templates and then submit. Customers can also see what other services are provided as each barber shop usually differ in this regard. Once the design is submitted the customer can then choose the time and date and pay from there. This step will remove the waiting times from the customer and paying before hand would eliminate anytime wasters. On arrival to the barber shop the customer must provide proof of their identity. 
This will be simply done by providing each customer their specific bar code which the barber shop can scan. The same bar code can be used to sign off the customer once they have received their hair cut. The bar code will only be available to the customer to avoid any scamming occurring. The app will also provide a feedback method, where customers can describe their experience. The barbers can also rate each customer which would encourage everyone to be on best behaviour. </p>
<p>The tools that would be needed to make this app would be programming software’s such as JavaScript, Html and Cascading style sheets. We would also need Cordova to develop the mobile application.</p>
<p>This project would need a lot of programming and coding skills, such as learning to use JavaScript, Html etc because we are trying to build an app. Marketing skills are also required to get barber shop to sign up with the app and to get the word on the street for customers to arrive. A good sense of designing will also help, this will mean app users will not easily get tired of the app and rather become more absorbed on the app which is ideal for business related projects. These skills will take a lot of time to master. Learning to code is 
difficult and will take a lot of time. This is one drawback for this 
project especially for me since I have no past experience in coding.</p>
<p>If the project is successful it would revolutionize the way, we know about cutting hair. It would allow for barber shops to find new customers and for people to find barber shops easily. It removes the main problem with barber shops, which is the waiting time. This beneficial for both the customer and barber as customer won’t have to wait and barbers will mostly be busy. The development of this app would open the gates and motivate other people with ideas to include technology with other daily activities. </p>
